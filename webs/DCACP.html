    <h1>A Dyeing Clustering Algorithm based on Ant Colony Path-finding Mechanism</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><nbsp><nbsp>Clustering has a wide range of applications in various industries. In different research ideas, 
        bionic algorithms have heuristic help for clustering research. However, most of the clustering 
        algorithms based on bionics often have problems of insufficient information extraction, too many
        required parameters, and limited application scope. Therefore, these algorithms have lower accuracy 
        than traditional clustering algorithms. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new ant colony 
        clustering algorithm, which is called DCACP (Dyeing Clustering Algorithm based on Ant Colony 
        Path-finding). This algorithm combines the idea of dyeing with pheromones for the first time and 
        realizes clustering by using ants to crawl and dye each point. This can better capture data features, 
        improve fault tolerance and achieve a better clustering effect. In addition, the algorithm is 
        constructed as a dynamic system to deeply mine data information with the strategy of swarm 
        intelligence, including the ant colony generation model, path-finding model, path-finding 
        termination model, and dyeing clustering model. Besides, to evaluate the algorithm, we selected 2 
        simulation data sets, 5 artificial data sets, 5 real-world data sets, 9 comparison algorithms, and 8 
        evaluation indexes. From the comprehensive multi-round experiments, seven of the eight evaluation 
        indexes of the DCACP algorithm are more advantageous than other comparison algorithms. In 
        addition, the relevant code can be obtained at <a href="https://github.com/firesaku/DCACP">GitHub</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><b>Background: </b>Clustering can be applied to a variety of life scenes, for example, clustering biological data can help us develop drugs to treat diseases like CVOID-19 and breast cancer, and clustering weather data can help us prevent natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Although clustering is widely used, the existing clustering methods often have such problems: (1) the capture of data features is not clear. (2) the number of clusters needs to be specified in advance. (3) the fault tolerance is low. Therefore, in this paper, a Dyeing Clustering algorithm based on Ant Colony Path-finding (DCACP), is proposed to solve these problems.</p>
    <p><b>Motiviton:</b>Most of the traditional clustering algorithms have achieved the purpose of clustering, they often 
        have these shortcomings. (1) The relationship between points is only processed by Euclidean 
        distance quantization, so the capture of the relationship is still limited, which is difficult to deal with 
        high-dimensional data. (2) The number of clusters needs to be specified in advance before clustering, 
        and the algorithm is often subjective, so the selection of parameters has certain restrictions on the 
        clustering results. (3) It is necessary to find the center of each cluster for clustering, which has a 
        good effect on Gaussian distribution data sets, but the performance is poor on other types of data 
        sets. Therefore, we propose a more accurate algorithm, which not only does not need to specify the 
        number of clusters, but also automatically generates the target results by the swarm intelligence 
        through this structure, and is suitable for all kinds of data distribution. In particular, the idea of 
        applicating dyeing to ant colony clustering will inspire artificial intelligence systems.</p>
        <p>Our algorithm includes the following 4 parts. (1) Ant Colony Generation Model. (2) Path-finding Model. (3) Path-finding Termination Model. (4) Dyeing Clustering. To evaluate the algorithm, we selected 2 simulation data sets, 5 artificial data sets, 5 real-world data sets, 9 comparison algorithms and 8 evaluation indexes. According to 30-round experiments, 7 of the 8 evaluation indexes show DCACP algorithm is more advantageous than other comparison algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, experiments were compared with a variety 
        of well-known clustering algorithms, including classical algorithms based on Message Passing, 
        Hierarchical, Density, Partitioning, and Ant Clustering.</p>

        <p>The datasets used in this experiment are divided into three parts, which are simulated data set, 
            artificial data set and real-world data set for algorithm verification. For the simulation data set, we 
            established 2 types of data distribution with Gaussian distribution characteristics. Since most cluster 
            structures have this characteristic, they are used to verify the correctness of the algorithm. In 
            addition, in order to better demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm, we use 5 artificial datasets 
            , and the data in these datasets show different distributions. Finally, in order to 
            prove that the algorithm can deal with various challenges of clustering tasks in real world, we use 
            five real data sets as verification</p>

        <p>In terms of evaluation indicators, we adopt 8 evaluation indicators, which 
            can measure the clustering effect from different angles, so as to obtain objective and comprehensive 
            evaluation and analysis.

<h2>Conclution</h2>
<p>Clustering can be applied to various industries. Examples with similar attributes are classified 
    into the same cluster, and hidden rules and knowledge in various industries are explored through 
    unsupervised learning. In this paper, a bionic algorithm DCACP is proposed, which completes 
    clustering by the dyeing mechanism of the ant colony. This study applies bionics to artificial 
    intelligence systems and innovatively proposes the idea of dyeing. The combination of dyeing and 
    pheromone will provide a reference for researchers of the clustering algorithm. The idea of 
    combining bionics and artificial intelligence is helpful for the innovation of artificial intelligence 
    systems. The algorithm conducts system modelling around the four objectives of ant generation, 
    path finding, termination finding and dyeing clustering, and finally forms the DCACP architecture. 
    It has a good clustering effect on virtual datasets and real-world datasets. However, there is still 
    room for improvement in time complexity, so the next work will still take bionics as the perspective 
    to further improve the accuracy of the algorithm while considering the redundancy problem. Later 
    research will continue to expand the research objectives, aimed at applying it in engineering 
    applications research.
